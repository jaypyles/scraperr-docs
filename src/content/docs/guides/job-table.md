## Favoriting Jobs

Jobs can be favorited by clicking the star icon in the far left of the table. This will add the job to the favorited jobs section. This will allow you to view all of the favorited jobs by clicking the "Favorited Jobs" button in the top left of the table. From there, you can unfavorite a job by clicking the star icon again.

This allows you to save jobs that you may want to come back to later.

## AI Integration

The Job Table also has an AI integration, which allows you to ask questions about the jobs in the table. To use this, click the `Chat` button in the far right of the table. This will open a chat window where you can ask questions about the jobs in the table.
